# DBClientFiles.NET
The new version of DBFilesClient.NET.

## Status

* Fix CodeGenerator.Clone to handle deep copying instead of shallow.
* Implement recursive calls to CodeGenerator so that users can more easily integrate complex types into their definitions (`C3Vector`, etc).
* Optimize all this shit.
